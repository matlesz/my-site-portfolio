Hi, I'm **Mat Leszkiewicz** — a cybersecurity enthusiast with a background in computer science, DevOps, and technical support engineering. After completing a Higher Diploma in Computer Science at South East Technological University, I’ve focused my learning and professional development on cybersecurity, threat intelligence, and Security Operations Center (SoC) methodologies.

Currently, I work as a Technical Support Engineer at Intercom, where I debug complex issues, build internal tools, and contribute to incident response. My past experience also includes a DevOps internship at FundRecs, where I developed AWS CI/CD pipelines and security infrastructure, and earlier roles at TikTok and Accenture in model optimization and content moderation.

With hands-on experience in Python, Java, JavaScript, cloud services like AWS, and tools like Elasticsearch, Git, and Docker, I aim to bridge the gap between engineering and security.

I'm passionate about learning, resilient in challenges, and always curious about how systems work—and how they can be secured. My goal is to transition into a full-time **cybersecurity analyst** role, where I can apply my skills to detect, respond to, and prevent real-world threats.

When I'm not working or learning, I enjoy hiking, traveling, and diving deep into psychology and social engineering topics.
