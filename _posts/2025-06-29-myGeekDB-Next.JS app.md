[**geekDb**](https://geek-db.vercel.app/?genre=fetchNowPlaying) is a full-stack web application inspired by IMDB, developed as part of my journey to deepen my skills in frontend and backend web development using the modern **Next.js framework**. The project focuses on building a user-friendly, responsive interface with real-time CRUD operations connected to a MongoDB backend.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Build a scalable full-stack web app with **Next.js** and **MongoDB**
- Practice **server-side rendering (SSR)** and **API route handling**
- Create a modern UI using **Tailwind CSS**
- Implement basic CRUD functionality for movie entries

---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React, Next.js, TailwindCSS
- **Backend**: Next.js API Routes, MongoDB
- **Database**: MongoDB Atlas (cloud-hosted NoSQL)
- **Authentication**: Simple local routing (future version could use OAuth/Auth0)

## 🧠 What I Learned

- How to connect a Next.js frontend with a cloud-hosted MongoDB backend
- Writing modular API endpoints inside the `/pages/api` directory
- Styling modern UI layouts using Tailwind CSS utility classes
- Handling dynamic routing and data fetching in SSR

---

## 🚧 Future Improvements
