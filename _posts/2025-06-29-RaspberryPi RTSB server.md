As part of my academic and personal learning journey into system design, networking, and edge computing, I developed a lightweight **RTSP (Real-Time Streaming Protocol) video server** using a **Raspberry Pi**. The project focused on creating a low-cost, self-hosted solution to stream real-time video over a local network — ideal for CCTV-style setups or media streaming experiments.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

To use a Raspberry Pi as a standalone **RTSP server** that captures live video from a camera module and broadcasts it over the network to compatible video players (e.g., VLC, ffmpeg, or NVR software).

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- **Hardware**: Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+
- **Camera**: Pi Camera Module v2
- **OS**: Raspberry Pi OS Lite
- **Streaming Software**: `v4l2loopback`, `ffmpeg`, `nginx` (optional for UI), `rpicam` utilities
- **RTSP Protocol**: For real-time video delivery
- **SSH & CLI tools**: For headless setup and monitoring

---

## 🛠️ Implementation Steps

1. Installed **Raspberry Pi OS Lite** for headless setup
2. Enabled camera and SSH access
3. Installed required dependencies:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install ffmpeg v4l-utils v4l2loopback-dkms
   ```
4. Used **ffmpeg** to stream Pi Camera output:
   ```bash
   ffmpeg -f video4linux2 -i /dev/video0 -f rtsp rtsp://<ip-address>:8554/live.stream
   ```
5. Configured port forwarding and service autostart for continuous availability

## 📺 How to View the Stream

To access the live stream, use any RTSP-compatible client like:

```bash
vlc rtsp://<raspberry-pi-ip>:8554/live.stream
```

Or embed it in web platforms or dashboards for real-time monitoring.

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Configuring **low-latency video streaming** on Linux-based systems
- Optimizing Raspberry Pi performance for real-time media processing
- Managing **system services**, autostart, and headless device setup
- Basics of **network protocols** like RTSP and how video is handled at the protocol level

---

## 🧩 Potential Improvements

- Add motion detection or event-based triggers
- Secure stream with authentication or HTTPS proxying
- Integrate video archiving functionality
- Build a web dashboard for stream management
